# Decorators

To be able to transform a class into a valid vuex store object, we use decorators. The following decorators are defined:

- [@VuexClass](/decorators/vuex-class)
- [@Getter](/decorators/getter)
- [@Mutation](/decorators/mutation)
- [@HasGetter](/decorators/has-getter)
- [@HasGetterAndMutation](/decorators/has-getter-and-mutation)
- [@Action](/decorators/action)
